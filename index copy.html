          <h3>Experience and passion count!</h3>

          I've been working as a designer since 2009. When I first learned to code and design my first
          website the technology was "Tables". It was tough and demanded a lot of commitment but the passion helped me
          to persist until
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>It is evident! I like working in a team</h3>
          At the beginning I learned to code alone(self-taught) but later on I created AKARIHO Graphix -
          A multi-talent team, my former colleagues taught me how to share ideas, brainstorm, search
          and to bring the best out of me as I knew it was my responsibility to carry out my task so that the teamwork
          would not fail because of me.
          I learned to work and share values with my colleagues to satisfy the needs of our clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3>Easy to work with</h3>
          My former clients say i’m friendly, responsive,
          professional, helpful, innovative, and flexible. I work closely
          with clients to ensure the finer 'design' details are taken
          care of effortlessly and efficiently to help make your creation a
          success. From the Wireframe to the final product we are in full contact of our customers
          to ensure the satisfaction of their needs
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3>Always Innovative</h3>
          I am constantly evolving and creating
          graphic and websites designs that are FRESH, relevant, and appealing to EVERYONE!
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Website's quality and
          durability; and generous user-friendly that allows for
          visitors to acheive an access and navigation.
